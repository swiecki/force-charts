Force Charts
================

This is an integration of two javascript libraries, [TechanJS](https://github.com/andredumas/techan.js/) by Andre Dumas and [Labella.js](https://github.com/twitter/labella.js/) by Twitter. Force charts allows for the creation of technical SVG stock charts with force-directed labels for given days. The idea is to be able to quickly generate charts with explanations of stock moves - earnings reports, preannoucements, product launches, etc.

Screenshot coming soon.
